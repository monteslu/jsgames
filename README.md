## JS Games

These are sample web games made with JavaScript meant for use with the [jsgamelauncher](https://github.com/monteslu/jsgamelauncher). They are meant to be used as a reference for making your own games and can be a starting point for your own projects.

You can run these games locally. Each one is a bit different but the general idea is that you might want to "build" the game and then run it or maybe you can just run it. For example, the "simple-vite" game will run after `npm install` and `npm run dev` as you would expect with a Vite project. But there is no requirement to use Vite.

## Conventions

If a game starts with "sample" it is meant to be a starting point for your own project. If it ends in "-ai" that means we used an AI to make the game by starting out with one of those sample projects and then chatting with an AI to make it into a finished game.
